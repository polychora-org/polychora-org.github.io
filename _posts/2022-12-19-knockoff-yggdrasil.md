```
Golden sap is dripping on my tongue
Left my body but my soul's tied up

No more caring for material things
Fruit is plucked from the ethereal tree

Golden caustics of the wine at dusk
So much damage doing what you must

Rooted stance for the sidereal queen
Life dissolved in immaterial dream

If you forget
What life you led
They say the Prince of Death
With his unblinking gaze
Will remind you

Gilded tether binding you to me
Life is burning, love is setting free
```
