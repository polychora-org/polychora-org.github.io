<p><a id="zine"></a></p>

<p>This zine is comprised of poems written from 2011 to 2013 (all before my transition). Most could use work, but I felt the urge to spill them out onto the riverbed and swim away.</p>

<h2 id="insect">Insect</h2>

<p>Crawling where wall meets ceiling:<br/>
your sibling from the windowpane shone<br/>
like a black seed spotted with red.<br/>
If I crushed you, would you turn<br/>
into cochineal, once-white braids churning<br/>
in a bucket of silken entrails?</p>

<p>(When I fled the poem it remained, hovering<br/>
just behind, papered over, luminous:<br/>
The first time I nearly wept. And after that</p>

<h2 id="blanket">Blanket</h2>

<p>Gray skin covers the fused body,<br/>
pockmarks resolving themselves<br/>
as floral print. Under it, pressure<br/>
which says, this is my flesh, that<br/>
is your flesh, separable finally<br/>
not by any act of the mind<br/>
but through cruel proprioception,<br/>
arriving with the dawn by which<br/>
our skin was flensed.</p>

<p>Waking with a dead limb<br/>
doesn’t frighten you anymore.<br/>
Even if the blood refused<br/>
to flow again, if the limb<br/>
withered and was cut—<br/>
at least some nights<br/>
you’d forget what went missing,<br/>
or dream how, like a starfish,<br/>
you had grown it back.</p>

<h2 id="i-reach-out-for-you">I reach out for you</h2>

<p>in the shape of a laptop</p>

<p>light stains my hands and upper body</p>

<p>At the moment the rain stops there are still<br/>
drops falling but no more will</p>

<p>follow — they cling to the red maple,<br/>
seep into the soil, unattended</p>

<p>The silence does not break easily<br/>
I open my window to moist air</p>

<p>Gutters burbling<br/>
lines of glistening beads</p>

<p>Outside a woman describes a series of ex-<br/>
lovers, each more pitiful than the last</p>

<p>Somewhere someone I do not know<br/>
is writing the same poem</p>

<h2 id="winter-was-over-before">Winter was over before</h2>

<p>We knew it. The groundhog is wrong<br/>
Sixty-one percent of the time.<br/>
Here in this light-filled room,<br/>
Forecasts could not predict<br/>
A kiss, a failed liaison.<br/>
I had forgotten — days.<br/>
Days press on. Still the body knows<br/>
It is spring. The eyes cannot<br/>
Stop tearing. My skin<br/>
Inflamed with pollen. Now<br/>
This fresh-mown grass is trying to<br/>
Impregnate me. Broadcast its seed<br/>
Along the wind. When I lay down<br/>
In its field for a time unmarked<br/>
With shadow, I felt it seethe<br/>
Beneath me, struggling to rise.<br/>
Where I crushed it, it is growing<br/>
Into my body, slowly.<br/>
Red marks on my hands,<br/>
Backs of my knees.</p>

<h2 id="jokkmokk">Jokkmokk</h2>

<p>Open your eyes: let the forest darkness<br/>
rasp across them, the low gray fog<br/>
spread its dim line, cutting off the trees<br/>
at their roots, occulting the river,<br/>
the shapes of islands… North<br/>
of the Arctic Circle, summer light<br/>
long gone, heavy black curtains<br/>
folded unused in the hotel room.</p>

<p>Night fell who knew how long ago.<br/>
We could not tell if the earth<br/>
stayed pinned on its axis.<br/>
In a subterranean place,<br/>
within a dream,<br/>
my body vivisected itself<br/>
splaying outward like a flower.</p>

<h2 id="cold-out-tonight">Cold Out Tonight</h2>

<p>There can be no excuse for you<br/>
however young, however beloved.<br/>
Oh, you are graceless; you elbow<br/>
him in the head with each slightest<br/>
shifting of your slight body, making<br/>
restless orbits like a distant moon.<br/>
Prone to tremors as if of remorse.</p>

<p>Don’t hold the night<br/>
responsible. It is not<br/>
what kills them. It is not<br/>
why blood turns sluggish and dark<br/>
in the soft hollows under the eyes.</p>

<p>The crisis is always all around and just<br/>
at bay. Come to bed, love. Cold out tonight.</p>

<p>)</p>
