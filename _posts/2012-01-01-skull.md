<img src="/img/skull.jpg" alt="Skull with jeweler&#39;s loupes in eyes, headphones coming from the base"></img>

<p>Made for a course on “Art and Place,” exploring Providence’s Jewelry District.
The skull contained a stereographic image of a blood-red sapling growing in the
space left behind by the demolition of an overpass. The image could be seen by
holding the skull against your face and looking through the jeweler’s loupes; a
slowing heartbeat played through the headphones.</p>
